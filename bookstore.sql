This autobiography is a genuine, earnest and fascinating narrative straight from the actors heart and mind that discloses for the first time several unknown aspects of the life and times of Dilip Kumar one of the greatest Bollywood actors of all time, and also stands out as an icon of a secular India. Dilip Kumar was born as Yousuf Khan. He started as a shy rookie in Hindi cinema in the early 1940s and there was no looking back. He went on to reach the zenith of stardom within a short period of time. He delivered mesmerizing performances in one hit movie after another, in a row! His almost sixdecadelong career as an actor was based only on his original ability, unwavering willpower, sheer hard work and diehard optimistic attitude. In this book, Dilip Kumar tells us his journey right from his birth, his days as an aspiring actor, his ascent to the pinnacle of success and the rest, to the present day. He frankly narrates his relationships with different variety of people. His interactions were not only restricted to his family, friends and the film world but also with businessmen and politicians. Dilip Kumar sets the record straight about how he got married to Saira Banu, one of the then Bollywood beauties. He feels that a lot of what was written about him so far is mostly misinterpreted, and so he narrates, in graphic detail, about his romantic relationship and marriage, which pretty much reads like a fairy tale! He fondly remembers the event that changed his life forever his meeting with Devika Rani, the boss of the famous Bombay Talkies, and being offered an acting job. His first film was Jwar Bhata (1944). He explains how he had to learn the whole kit and caboodle from scratch and how he had to cultivate his own individual dramatics and panache that would set him apart from his contemporaries. He soon scaled great heights with movies like Jugnu, Shaheed, Mela andaz, Deedar, Daag and Devdas. In most of his movies he played the tragedian with such a matchless intensity that his mind was undesirably affected. He had to consult a British psychiatrist, who counselled him to shift to play comedy. The consequence was his remarkable performances in the hilarious, laugh riots like Azaad and Kohinoor, apart from an amusing depiction as a resolute Tongdriver in Naya Daur. He then took a fiveyear break and later began his second innings with Kranti in 1981, post which he acted in successions of hits such as Vidhaata, Karma, Saudagar, Mashaal, Shakti, and Qila.', 'English', 450, 500),

However, selecting the right career option is one of the most difficult decisions for a student. Almost all of us go through this dilemma after passing class 12th exams. While some are aware of the courses available and the right approach to go for it to reach their career goals, while others are clueless about the courses or the colleges to take admission in.Today, there are lot many options for class XII pass outs, in which they can pursue their graduation. However, there are no safe careers as such. One will do well in life if they follow their interest. The course one selects for graduation is the stepping stone towards building his/her career, so whatever course one chooses, it must be in accordance to his/her passion. Also, the course one chooses must assure a good scope for career options. Select a field that has chances of growth in the future. Countercheck all the details about the course and its significance in the industry. It happens often that we are misled by the opinions of others and take wrong decisions, so make sure you do not fall prey to any kind of pre-conceived assumptions. College will get over in three years but the course will stay forever. Its also better to get a general undergraduate degree than go for a programme that restricts future options, if ones unsure where ones heart lies. If a student has an interest in more than one course, they should choose the one that has a broader scope. The possibility of doing post-graduation in that subject is then higher, since fewer seats are available at the postgraduate level. Students should always take admission in the first college if he/she gets an opportunity to do so. With every list, the options would increase and with it the liberty to switch colleges and get admission in ones preferred college. When it comes to choosing between a course and a college, the emphasis should be firmly on the first. It doesnt make much of a difference which college a student gets an undergraduate degree from but the course will matter.It is important that students choose a suitable stream in class 12 to ensure that they are able to join a career of their choice after passing the 12th exams.

Asura - Tale Of The Vanquished dares to narrate the tale of the Asura people. Blending mythology, religion and history, the book narrates the tale from Ravana and Bhadra''s perspective.The book talks about how the Asura community is more liberal than the orthodox Deva clan, which was highly biased. It also attacks the evil practices of the Brahmin caste. From the tale of Mahabali, Vamana and Sitas Agni-Pareeksha, to Jatayus meeting with Ravana, the author reveals the many human emotions behind these stories and logically presents a new perspective for the readers.How wrong was Ravana to challenge the mighty gods for his daughter''s sake? Was he evil for deciding to lead life in his own terms? Was he wrong for freeing the people from the caste-cased Deva reign? The author takes the readers on an enthralling journey and poses many such complex questions.Bhadra is a creative character who gives voice to the common man, who is lost amidst the villains and heroes. The author has been appreciated for his eye for detail, which gives life to his work. The right blend of good language and interesting twists keeps the book engaging.
